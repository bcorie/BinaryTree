Four score and seven years ago our fathers
brought ,forth on this continent, a new na-tion,
conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal..
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated,
can long endure.
